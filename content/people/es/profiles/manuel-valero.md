## Short Biosketch

My research is focused in the neural interplay of excitatory and inhibitory activity in cortical networks and how these dynamics create neural representations and memories. I am Group Leader at the [Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (IMIM)](https://www.imim.es/en_index.html), Barcelona (Spain).

I did my postdoc (2018-2022) in the laboratory of [György Buzsáki](https://buzsakilab.com/wp/) at NYU Neuroscience Institute, New York (US). Funded by the EMBO and the HFSP I developed novel high-resolution optogenetics strategies and I studied inhibitory neural motifs.

During my Ph.D. in the laboratory of [Liset Menéndez de la Prida](http://hippo-circuitlab.es) I used a wide set of
tools – single-cell recordings in freely-moving rodents, simultaneous intracellular and
extracellular recordings, large-scale multi-site electrophysiology and optogenetic manipulations – to describe the network architecture behind the hippocampal sharp-wave ripples in normal and epileptic brains.
