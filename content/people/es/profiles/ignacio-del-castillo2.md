# Ignacio del Castillo

## Short Biosketch

I am a PhD student in Biomedicine that obtained a LaCaixa Foundation - Doctoral INPhINIT fellowship to study the neural computations supporting memory at the laboratory of Manuel Valero in the[Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (IMIM)](https://www.imim.es/en_index.html). Currently, I am focused on the role of astrocytes in the context of hippocampal neural circuits underlying memory by combining chronic hippocampal electrophysiological recordings with hippocampal astrocytic calcium imaging (fiber photometry).

Outside academy, you will most likely find me doing some sports, attending at any rock/metal concert/festival, at a bar with my friends, exploring out in the wild or simply reading some fantastic stories from Brandon Sanderson.
