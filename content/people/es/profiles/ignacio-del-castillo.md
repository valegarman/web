## Short Biosketch

My research is focused in the neural interplay of excitatory and inhibitory activity in cortical networks and how these dynamics create neural representations and memories. I am Group Leader at the [Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (IMIM)](https://www.imim.es/en_index.html), Barcelona (Spain).
