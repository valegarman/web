    content: Ipshita Zutshi performed combined optogenetic and pharmacogenetic local and upstream inactivation of CA1! She showed that CA1 induce and maintain coordinated cell assemblies with minimal reliance on its inputs from CA3 and EC.

    content: Pyramidal cells and GABAergic interneurons fire together in balanced cortical networks. In contrast to this general rule, we describe a distinct neuron type expressing ID2 and Nkx2.1, whose spiking activity is anti-correlated with all principal cells.

    content: How do firing patterns in a cortical circuit change when inhibitory neurons are excited? Stephanie Rogers and Peter Rozman found that Chemogenic activation of interneurons can bring about unexpected short-term and long-term changes in circuit dynamics.
