    content: Ipshita Zutshi combined optogenetic/pharmacogenetic local and upstream inactivation of CA1. She showed that CA1 induce and maintain coordinated cell assemblies with minimal reliance on its inputs from CA3 and EC.

    content: Pyramidal cells and GABAergic interneurons fire together in balanced cortical networks. In contrast to this general rule, we describe a distinct neuron type expressing ID2 and Nkx2.1, whose spiking activity is anti-correlated with all principal cells.

    content: How do firing patterns in a cortical circuit change when inhibitory neurons are excited? Stephanie Rogers and Peter Rozman found that Chemogenic activation of interneurons can bring about unexpected short-term and long-term changes in circuit dynamics.
